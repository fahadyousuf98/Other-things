FOR THE FIRST REQUIRED QUESTION. (COPY THE WORDINGS BELOW)

I’m have recently graduated in computer systems engineering. So right now I am trying to find jobs but unfortunately unable to do so, but still trying. My city doesn’t offer much jobs which could be related with my degree, but there are some jobs that if had a know about of various topics, I could easily avail the chance. System administration is one of those courses. It offers various expertise which could be helpful in landing me to a job. 
Now I could have done this course from somewhere else as well, i.e. like paying a fees but at the moment, I am not in a condition to pay anything, The reason is my father’s low income. We live a quite restricted life financially so there is no possibility that I could’ve afford this course sooner or later. In my view, if I really do get the financial aid it would be really helpful for me.

Taking this course will not only help me achieve my goals but also will help in getting various jobs which could help our family financially. This course has good set of content which can basically help any one, which is trying to come in the IT sector. The course content is quite informative as well. From basic to expert level, the syllabus covers it all. After I will finish this course, my mind would be more open then that which field I should selecting onwards. Especially would help me decide that I which field I should be applying for my master level education. Whether I should be actually studying this or not, or should I switch to some different field. Also how much content related to networking is included in this course. Whether should choosing networking in my profession or not? I’m hoping that all such ambiguities will be cleared by this course and that, this course will help me a lot as well
